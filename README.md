# adv-net-rl
Code repository for studying the threat of adversarial policies against defensive RL agents for network security.

Running this code requires CybORG version 1.2 to be installed. 

Copying the agents included in the `agents/` into the Agents directory of the CybORG installation will enable the existing agents to be loaded into the environment.
